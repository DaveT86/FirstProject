###Site owner's goal :

###Potential Features to Include :
*Stong brand.
*Informative Landing Page.
*Easy to navigate between recipes.
*Area for users to submit recipes.
*Link to other sites which share similar interests.

###Design

####Landing Page

*My initial design choice was to have a large hero image on the sites landing page

*However I did not like the way this intereacted with smaller viewing devices and I made the decision to make my informative website more informative from the get go whilst still maintaining a good first impression.
*My revised landing page took into account the responsiveness required for veiwing on PC, Phone and Tablet and I was confident that I would be able to implement it using flex properties in css.

####Recipe Page

*My initial intention for the recipe page went far beyond and above the requirment for the project, a sleek looking website utilising I-frames with follow along instructions and recipe information containing a lot of data.
*My eventual implementation I feel still meets the external users goal and delivers on my goals at the site owner even though it is is overly simplistic.
*My eventual design choice was to go for a single web page with anchors for each recipe and then external links to the actual recipe featured on other websites.

####Contact Page

*The last page of my website is very simple utilising an embedded google form to allow viewers to give feedback and offer suggestions for future content for the website, I went for this option not only because of it's ease in implentation but because it's far easier to collate and process the data given through it.

###Testing

*My initial testing highlighted a few problems which were not too hard to address, mainly issues with margin and spacing, I did spend significant time thinking about and tasting the best implementation for my nav bar on mobile, a lot of complicated very clever solutions were tried however I felt the best was was just to diable the on hover sub menu in the nav bar on smaller devices, it's a clean and effective solution.

*My CSS code succesfully passed the W3C Validator




###Sources

In order to make my nav bar appear how I wanted I had to use some cutom css styling derived from code mentioned here, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51295524/how-to-create-a-box-with-slanted-edges

Google forms, the website uses an embedded google form to allow people to submit suggestions for future content to the website, google forms was chosen over creating a form mainly because I do not have an email address I'm willing to commit to the site and not currently in the posession of the tools to implement .php.

Chat-Gpt proved to be an invaluable tool for offering suggestions to fix problems I encountered and also for proof reading text content and code within the site https://chatgpt.com/
