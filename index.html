                <h2> What is Carrot Lox?</h2>
                <p>
                    Carrot lox is bloody nice, which is the most important thing, it's typically considerd to be an alternative to salmon and it's surprisingly easy to make and it keeps in the fridge for a reasonable amount of time, so come and have a look at some of these easy to make carrot lox recipes.

                <h2> What is Vegan Mayonaise</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm sure you've seen Vegan Mayonaise in your local supermarket and looked at it with a confused looked on your face, or is that just me? Well.... anyway, Vegan Mayonaise is yummy and surprisingly easy to make, it does require an appliance that may not be in every kitchen.

                <h2> Mushroom Burger???</h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of beef mince the mushroom burgers I'm on about are made out of minced mushrooms with some added herbs and spices, there's plenty of room to experiment and the taste is different enough from a regular burger that "ooooohhh I'll have a mushroom burger today!!" is something you could conceivably say, just because you fancy a mushroom burger today.
