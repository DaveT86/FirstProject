##Areas Highlighted for correction

*1.2 Design a website that meets
accessibility guidelines (e.g.
contrast between background
and foreground colours, non-text
elements have planned
alternative text equivalents to
cater for the visually impaired).

*1.4 Ensure that foreground
information is never distracted by
backgrounds.

*1.5 Include graphics that are
consistent in style and colour.


##1.2

Having reviewed some additional learning material I decided to download a chrome extension called Sliktide accesibility checker to assess the use of colours used and the contrast between them. The colours used all pass the relevant checks as I had anticipated they would because they were chosen intentionally.

I converted all page headers from H2's to H1's to follow proper convention, making it better for screen readers and seo purposes.
I added a H1 to recipe page for the same reason.

Reduced the text length of the landing page header to improve first impression on smaller screen sizes which better highlights the images.

Improved alt tags for some of the images.

##1.4

When I had the .active effect initiated on my navbar causing the tab to be partially shaded, I can see the issues it may have caused in contrast with the text, the way it's implemented is what I thought to be a clever yet simple implementation which I discovered myself by converting the border to a different style basically just to give that effect, maybe I got too hung up on how clever I thought that was so I have removed that and instead implemented some text styling to the active page on the navbar.

Slightly reduced the alpha of the hover effect on the navbar to improve contrast between the text and the applied background.

##1.5

All the images featured on my site were designed enitrely by myself using the same software and palettes, even if I was to acknowledge this issue which I don't the time required to fix it would be too substantial so no changes have been made to address this.
